The Marketing Team: As a researcher I want to know what items in the catalog are most likely to sell. I would also want to know how often that product is chosen as compared to the other products offered by single user and by the collective.

The Developer: As the developer I want to display three images at a time for a total of 25 times and track which image is clicked on among the displayed images and how often it is clicked on. Basically:
    1. Number of times an image is clicked on
    2. Number of times an image is viewed
    3. Limit the number of times a user can vote (25times)
    4. Display three images at time
    5. Prevent duplication between to successive groups of three images (above and below a set of three images).
I want to achieve this objective because it is what was outlined in the marketing team as to what they want their final product to look like

The Focus Group: As a focus participant I want to give my opinion on what type of items I want BusMall to provide for me while I fly. I also want to be compensated for my time and effort.
